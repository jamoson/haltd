The hald package contains two daemons, haltd and batteryd.

haltd		listens to a network port, and accepts the commands
		halt, shutdown, reboot and help.
		This can be used to remotely shut down a plan 9
		from another machine. For example systemd on Linux
		can shut down plan 9 machines.
		Default port: 5000

 
batteryd	Monitors the battery status of a laptop,
		issuing a shutdown if the charge falls
		below a limit (mA) - default 5 mA.

		In order to really shut down the machine,
		and avoiding the battery to be completely
		drained, check that the command 'fshalt'
		shuts off the machine. You might have to
		add the line *acpi=1 in plan9.ini.

Both daemons write to the logfile: /sys/log/haltd.

Compile and install:

mk install

Note that you need system privilieges to install.

# Automatic start of the deamons
# the daemons can be started on booting by adding the
following lines to /cfg/$sysname/cpustart (or termrc).

aux/acpi
haltd &
batteryd &

Create the directory /cfg/$sysname if it doesn't exist,
and make the file (cpustart or termrc) executable.
For laptops, you might only want to run batteryd and for
servers only haltd.

Installation on Linux: (for using with haltd):

Put the Linuxscript in /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown
(it can have any name, but should be executable)
